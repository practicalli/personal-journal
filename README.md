## Sponsor Practicalli

[![Sponsor Practicalli via GitHub](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/practicalli/graphic-design/live/buttons/practicalli-github-sponsors-button.png)](https://github.com/sponsors/practicalli-johnny/)

All sponsorship funds are used to support the continued development of [Practicalli series of books and videos](https://practical.li/), although most work is done at personal cost and time.

Thanks to [Cognitect](https://www.cognitect.com/), [Nubank](https://nubank.com.br/) and a wide range of other [sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/practicalli-johnny#sponsors) for your continued support

## Contributing

Contributions are most welcome for Practicalli Books and project.  However, as this is a personal journal, this specific repository does not take pull requests.

Please read the [detailed Practicalli contributing page](https://practical.li/contributing/) to help you to help Practicalli.


## GitHub Actions

The megalinter GitHub actions will run when a pull request is created,checking basic markdown syntax.

A review of the change will be carried out by the Practicalli team and the PR merged if the change is acceptable.

The Publish Book GitHub action will run when PR's are merged into main (or the Practicalli team pushes changes to the default branch).

Publish book workflow installs Material for MkDocs version 9


## Local development

Install the Python3 Pip package manager using the Debian package manager:

```shell
apt install python3-pip pipx
```

Create and activate a python virtual environment

```shell
python -m venv ~/venv/ && source ~/venv/bin/activate
```

Use pip3 to install mkdocs-material, along with the plugins used by the Practicalli site (plugins are also installed in the GitHub Action workflow)

```shell
pip3 install mkdocs-material mkdocs-callouts mkdocs-glightbox mkdocs-git-revision-date-localized-plugin mkdocs-redirects mkdocs-rss-plugin pillow cairosvg
```

> pillow and cairosvg python packages are required for [Social Cards](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/setup/setting-up-social-cards/)


MacOSX has not been tested, although it is assumed homebrew approach is the most likely to work.

```shell
brew install python@3.12
```

---

Fork the GitHub repository and clone that fork to your computer,

```shell
git clone https://github.com/<your-github-account>/<repository>.git
```

Run a local server from the root of the cloned project

```shell
make docs
```

The website will open at <http://localhost:8000>

If making smaller changes, then only rebuild the content that changes, speeding up the local development process

```shell
make docs-changed
```

> NOTE: navigation changes may not be correctly reflected without reloading the page in the web browser or carrying out a full `make docs` build
