A range of updates, new content and tool reviews and testing.  [Reviewed 75 solutions for 44 students on Exercism.io](https://twitter.com/practical_li/status/1327671242388893697) over the last two week, adding that advice and code walk-throughs to the Practicalli Clojure book.

Several high-quality REPL driven development videos will be released soon, awaiting some final editing and post processing.

## Practicalli Study Group
Continued solving Exercism.io challenges for the Live broadcasts, with a request to specifically do the Spiral Matrix challenge
* [090 - Code challenges - Exercism.io Space-Age challenge](https://youtu.be/7-LCVAtkP9o)
* [091 - Code challenges - Exercism.io Spiral Matrix challenge](https://youtu.be/Z5C7X1UN8yo)


## Practicalli Clojure
Add [SpaceVim](https://spacevim.org/) to Clojure Editors in book now the Clojure command line bug is fixed.  Continued adding REPL driven development approaches to solving Exercism.io challenges.

Launch Portal data navigator with any REPL using `:env/dev` and `:inspect/portal-cli` aliases. The REPL automatically evaluates the `dev/user.clj` source code file to require portal, open the portal window and add portal as a `tap>` source

+**New sections**
* [Exercism.io bob challenge](http://practical.li/clojure/coding-challenges/exercism/bob.html) - walking through two alternative solutions
* [SpaceVim and vim-fireplace install guide](http://practical.li/clojure/clojure-editors/editor-install-guides/spacevim-fireplace.html) - including clj-kondo
* [SpaceVim and vim-fireplace user guide](http://practical.li/clojure/clojure-editors/editor-user-guides/spacevim-fireplace.html) - a quick guide to get started.

**Updated**
* [Portal - auto-start portal on REPL startup](https://practical.li/clojure/data-inspector/portal/#open-portal-on-repl-startup)
* [Clojure CLI tools version used with CircleCI](http://practical.li/clojure/continuous-integration/circle-ci/) and updating scripts to use latest Clojure CLI tools release and -M flag with aliases.
* nrepl and cider aliases for the Reveal data visualization tool (Reveal deprecated)


## Practicalli clojure-cli-config
Updates and fixes to the user level configuration for Clojure CLI projects.  Added clj-kondo as a GitHub action to lint all pull requests and commits, ensuring aliases are in a good state.

* [Alternative REPLs](https://github.com/practicalli/clojure-cli-config#alternative-repls): socket server and prepl aliases
* `:inspect/reveal-nrepl` to run an nREPL server with Reveal data visualization
* `:inspect/reveal-light-nrepl` a light theme version with a 32 point Ubuntu Mono font useful for demos and HiDPI screens
* `:inspect/reveal-nrepl-cider` CIDER specific libraries and middleware configuration with `:inspect/reveal-light-nrepl-cider` as a light version
* `:test/cognitect-precompile` alias to compile tests before running Cognitect Labs test runner
* [Monthly update of library versions](https://github.com/practicalli/clojure-cli-config/blob/live/CHANGELOG.org#2020-11-08) for all aliases using `:project/outdated` alias
* `community/zulip-event` to [add community event to zulip chat](https://github.com/practicalli/clojure-cli-config#community-activities)
* `test/cloverage` add clojure exec options for cloverage (#8)
* `:inspect/reveal-nrepl` and `:inspect/reveal-light-nrepl` Cider specific aliases for Reveal data browser


## Practicalli Data Science
Created a new (alpha state) book to provide practical guides to using Clojure tools and libraries to build applications in a data science context.  Working with the [SciCloj community](https://scicloj.github.io/) to raise awareness of what is possible in this space and as I grow my understanding it will be captured in the Practicalli Data Science book.

* [Notespace section](https://practical.li/clojure-data-science/notebooks/notespace/) - created [a simple demo of the Notespace data science journal tool](https://github.com/practicalli/scicloj-notespace-simple-demo) for Clojure, combined with Portal to help browse large data sets.

## Practicalli ClojureScript
Updated to new Practicalli theme and put all project content first, moving overview and design content to the reference section.  The book will focus on figwheel-main, reagent and ClojureScript for the next quarter.

## Practicalli Spacemacs
Update [Clojure documentation section](https://practical.li/spacemacs/documentation/cider-doc/) to show Clojure and [Java documentation](https://practical.li/spacemacs/documentation/javadoc/) functions, including how to navigate to source code and specifications from help.

### Hacking CIDER
* [PR #2926](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider/pull/2926) - Tip to evaluate namespace before documentation lookup - added to Practicalli Spacemacs instead.
