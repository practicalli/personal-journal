**Thoughts for the week**

My personal plans for 2024 are not set in stone, but I would like to relocate to the countryside by the summer.


**Predictions for 2024**

The year of the AI lawsuits as more companies and individuals realise they content has been used to train AI models without permission or recompence.

Anthropocene is declared a new geographic era in the history of the earth, marking the significant change humanity has made to the planet (not for the good).

## Git 

Included files will use relative path from the current config file being read, if the full path is not used

implicity `**/` in front of `gitdir` file path if it does not start with `~`, `/` or `./`

ignore, commit templates, and allowed-signatures files seem to need the full path on MacOSX or can be defined relative to the home directory using tilde `~` expansion, e.g. `~/.config/git/ignore`

## Health

A hilly 65km cycle ride on Thursday to burn-off some winter solstace calories. A good time of 2 hours 48 minutes at an average speed of 23.2km per hour.

Gave the bike a nice shower to clean it up after the muddy Thursday ride.

Club or solo ride on Saturday, depending if there is a nice level 4 group to join.

Park run new years day tomorrow, aiming for 35 minutes or less.

Subscribed to Spotify using a free 3 month plan and work email address.  Will use account to identify instrumental music to focus during work and to unwind after work.
