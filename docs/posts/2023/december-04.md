**Thoughts for today**

How does it feel to be employed... wonderful.

## On-boarding

Meetings to introduce myself to the people I will be working with the most.  Nice to see a few familiar faces from the London Clojure community.

I had a very short start date so was given a temporary laptop to work on, although at the end of the day Apple delivered a new laptop to use.  Luckily, most of the things setup on the original laptop carry over to the new one quite easily.

The new laptop was enrolled to the company adminstration and the most recent Apple MacOXS update applied.  These take the most time, so good to get them out of the way in the background.

Using Notion.so which has a Daily Journal template to keep a work specific history of my thoughts and actions.

I am sure there was an Emacs mode for Notion :)
