**Thoughts for today**
         
How could the community help people find relevant and quality libraries to use for their own development projects?

## Clojurists Together Submission

Finding what libraries are available for Clojure is predominantly an internet search. There is a lack of central advice as to which of the many libraries available libraries to use and inconsistent opinions often provided.

Whilst there are many commonly used libraries, there are many commonly used alternatives.  There are numerous questions in the Clojurians Slack regarding libraries, from those new to Clojure and those more experienced.

### Project Goal

The Practicalli "Which Clojure Library" project would provide a consistent way to find and understand the purpose of Clojure libraries.  Each library description would be based on commercial and community experiences, not rely on unfiltered social media content.  The community would be able to update aspects of each library description to keep the information as relevant as possible.

### Major Features

- search for libraries by topic, e.g. web server, routing, html template, etc
- consistent information for each library (integration with Git for common project information)
- provide rationale, characteristics and usefulness of each project
- common stacks and describe their benefits and constraints (in a consistent way)
  - link to the major libraries that compose the stack

The first phase of the project would provide a website that included the most commonly used libraries, each with a comprehensive description of their purpose and related libraries / stacks.
