## Socks Socks Socks

My feet were the coldest part of myself when cycling at the weekend, so a visit to the [Feetus website](https://feetus.co.uk/) resulted in new socks on the way.

Injinji [liner socks](https://feetus.co.uk/shop/injinji-liner-lightweight-coolmax-mini-crew-toe-socks-gray/) will go underneth new [long socks](https://feetus.co.uk/shop/injinji-trail-crew-midweight-running-toe-socks-granite/), both toe-socks to reduce blisters and they can be warn with my Vibram "five-fingers" shoes on long winter walks.

As an extra treat, [Injinji Ultra Compression toe socks](https://feetus.co.uk/shop/injinji-ultra-compression-otc-toe-socks-black/) to help with recovery after cycling.


## Health tests

![Blood tests image](https://www.oncozine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Fotolia_202377709_Subscription_Monthly_M.jpg){align=right loading=lazy style="height:150px"}

A two and a half hour round trip walk to the hospital for another blood test.  There are closer places to get tested, although they did not have dates available before starting work.  Its a good excuse to get some exercise.  Results should be available early next week.

Covid in 2021 & 2022 contributed to diabeates (high blood sugar levels) and hyperthyroidism (low B12 levels). Due to very limited ability to do exercise and get out of the house during those years I also had high triglyceride levels and lower vitamin D levels.

The biggest concern was the blood oxygen levels of 93-95% during the more intense covid reactions.  Practicing breathing seems to be helping generally and whilst cycling.

Regular walking at the start of 2023 and 50-80km weekend rides from August should have made signficant improvements, assuming there are no other underlying conditions.  I am certainly feeling my most healthy since 2019 (although some aches from all the exercise).

Previous exercise routines during 2022 had reduced blood glucose and triglyceride levels close to normal levels, until another couple of covid infections.

For the last 3 years I've had the yearly flu vacination and get the Covid vacination as often as the United Kingdom government allow (which is only once a year now and really not enough).  This year I also had the one-off pnemonia vacination


## BeYou chair

After two and a half years I have a new office chair. I backed the BeYou Transforming chair on Tuesday, 15 Jun 2021 and today the chair arrived.

Assembling the chair was really simple and there is a good video guide.  The main part of the chair is reasuringly heavy, indicating that the chair will be quite durable.

I now sit on an angled backrest whilst kneeling on the main chair, as in the picture.  I'm finding the chair very comfortable so will have to ensure the cats dont steal it away from me.

Before Covid I used to stand all day when working, this helped with posture and burned a few extra calories too.  I will mix standing with sitting in the BeYou chair, assuming the cats allow it.

Will the BeYou chair be worth the cost?  Only time will tell, but so far its a very positive start and the cat has already market it as their teritory.


## Freecycle

Donating my existing office chair on Freecycle tomorrow, hopefully it will find a new home.  I must have had the chair about 15 years and it was still very comfortable.

The gas cylinder to raise the chair stopped working a few years ago (one reason to by a new chair).  A spacer was fitted to the chair to keep it in a maximum hight to extend its life.  Replacing or refilling the gas cylinder can be expensive and not always guaranteed to work.

I'll hunt through the house tomorrow to see if there are other items to donate.
