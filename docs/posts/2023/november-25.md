## Cycling

A [:globe_with_meridians: level 4 ride with the Bigfoot Cycling Club](https://www.strava.com/activities/10280941295), covering 80km in 3 hours 36 minutes.

Wrapped up warm with multiple layers:

- Spatz base layer & Spatz winter base layer
- La Passion merino jersy
- Spatz 4 season jacket
- merino gloves, thick wooly gloves, La passion cycling gloves (to avoid wear on wolly gloves)
- Spatz toe covers and woolie booly socks


## Neovim Quickfix

A little more research into understanding the Neovim quickfix mode.

Lots of notes that need organising when I'm not really sleepy from cycling.
