**Thoughts for today**

Feeling good from a deep sleep thanks to a good cycle ride.

Filling in some gaps in my Neovim knowledge

<!-- more -->

## Neovim 

Updating navigation page with quickfix, jumplist and changelist information

- [Neovim navigation commands](https://practical.li/neovim/neovim-basics/navigation/)

Added modes and key bindings to enter and leave modes.

Added command language keys, including verbs, modifiers and text objects

Still some organising to do around the basics of neovim (and a few more things to learn)

- [Multi-modal Editing](https://practical.li/neovim/neovim-basics/multi-modal-editing/)
