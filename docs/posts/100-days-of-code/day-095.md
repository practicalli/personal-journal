**Thoughts for today**
         
Team lunch with the team I will be working with in the new year.

The venue was a very basic restaurant but with nice food.  There are some interesting dynamics in the team, so will need to figure out how to work with them.

## Code from today

- [4Clojure #49 Split a sequence](https://github.com/practicalli/four-clojure/commit/ecb0b8a098daa580623aae39fe92eabac58bcf04) 


## AI Startup Team Lunch
    
Some awkwardness from the team as most people were meeting for the first time.  I asked lots of questions and tried to make connections although it seems there was some tension in the group.


## 4Clojure exercises

Carried on adding to the 4Clojure repository of solution write-ups.  Discussing challenge #49 Split a sequence.

There was a fairly easy solution using take and drop.  However, with a little digging into the `clojure.core` the `juxt` function was a great way to show some abstraction over the drop and take.
