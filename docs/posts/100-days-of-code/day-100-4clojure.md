**Thoughts for today**
   
100 days of code challenge completed.  Was it worth it?  Well yes, it got me coding almost every day, and overall I certainly achieved more than 100 hours of coding, more like several 100 hours of coding.  

I didnt do was work on a specific project every day, but that would have felt more like work and I enjoyed having a break from that routine.

Will I do a 100 days of code challenge again?  Not sure, its quite a hard thing to be consistent with.  I will certainly keep a developer journal from now on as it has been very useful.

##  4Clojure solutions write up

Continuing to write up a description on how I solved each 4Clojure exercise, explaining how I thought about the problem and different approaches possible.

Today was a write up and elaboration on the exercises I covered in yesterdays Clojure study group broadcast.
