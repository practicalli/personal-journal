**Thoughts for today**

Walking through [a video taking a functional approach to the TicTacToe game](https://youtu.be/_eO7EsXO2XE) for the Clojure study group.

## Code from today

- [Uppercase player names](https://github.com/practicalli/tictactoe-cli/commit/7340a474e1c7d25a65f22383b6a3848ed055b0bd)
- [Display board with a grid](https://github.com/practicalli/tictactoe-cli/commit/cef31c50181b6e7af16e586f9946b10672dc6f9d)
- [Refactor play-game to pure function](https://github.com/practicalli/tictactoe-cli/commit/c0ed5b42124540b0ad2d6dc21fa54e6127237dd6)


## Functional TicTacToe 

Make changes to the design of the board and players to make the code easier to read than the original code in the video by Brian Wills.

Refactor the `play-game` function to take `starting-board` and `player-sequence` as arguments rather than pulling in shared values (def).  Passing arguments also means that `play-game` can be called with different board states, useful for testing especially if a computer opponent was added as an option to the game play.

??? EXAMPLE "Refactor: play-game function"
    ```clojure title="src/tictactoe_cli/core.clj"
    (defn play-game
      "The game loop.
      We iterate through the player sequence (alternate player turns)
      until there is a winner or the board is full."
      [starting-board player-sequence]
      (loop [board starting-board
             player-sequence player-sequence]
        (let [winner (winner? board)]
          (println "Current board:")
          (display-board board)
          (cond
            winner              (println "Player " (player-name winner) " wins!")
            (full-board? board) (println "The game is a draw.")
            :else
            (recur
             (take-turn (first player-sequence) board)
             (rest player-sequence))))))

    (comment
      (play-game starting-board player-sequence))
    ```

It could be interesting to make an AI for both players and watch the output as a game progresses.  A dynamic web page view of the game simulation could producing a simulation like that seen at the end of the [War Games movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WarGames){target=_blank}.
