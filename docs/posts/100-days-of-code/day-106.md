**Thoughts for today**

Walking through [a video taking a functional approach to the Tic-Tac-Toe game](https://youtu.be/_eO7EsXO2XE) for the Clojure study group.


## Code from today

- [Uppercase player names](https://github.com/practicalli/tictactoe-cli/commit/7340a474e1c7d25a65f22383b6a3848ed055b0bd)
- [Display board with a grid](https://github.com/practicalli/tictactoe-cli/commit/cef31c50181b6e7af16e586f9946b10672dc6f9d)
- [Refactor play-game to pure function](https://github.com/practicalli/tictactoe-cli/commit/c0ed5b42124540b0ad2d6dc21fa54e6127237dd6)

## Functional Tic-Tac-Toe

Make changes to the design of the board and players to make the code easier to read than the original code in the video by Brian Wills.

Refactor the `play-game` function to take `starting-board` and `player-sequence` as arguments rather than pulling in shared values (def).  Passing arguments also means that `play-game` can be called with different board states, useful for testing especially if a computer opponent was added as an option to the game play.

!!! EXAMPLE "Refactor: play-game function"
    ```clojure title="src/tictactoe_cli/core.clj"
    (defn play-game
      "The game loop.
      We iterate through the player sequence (alternate player turns)
      until there is a winner or the board is full."
      [starting-board player-sequence]
      (loop [board starting-board
             player-sequence player-sequence]
        (let [winner (winner? board)]
          (println "Current board:")
          (display-board board)
          (cond
            winner              (println "Player " (player-name winner) " wins!")
            (full-board? board) (println "The game is a draw.")
            :else
            (recur
             (take-turn (first player-sequence) board)
             (rest player-sequence))))))

    (comment
      (play-game starting-board player-sequence))
    ```

It could be interesting to make an AI for both players and watch the output as a game progresses.  A dynamic web page view of the game simulation could producing a simulation like that seen at the end of the [War Games movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WarGames){target=_blank}.
