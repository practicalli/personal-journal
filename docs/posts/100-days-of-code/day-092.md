**Thoughts for the week**

Clojure Hack day was quite a small event however it gave us a chance to work on our own projects.  Worked with Mani on some basic Clojure skills.  Als worked on building a simple ClojureScript React style website with our primary school student (accompanied by her mom)

I also did a little more work with Scalable Vector Graphics, in the system monitor project I started a while ago.

SkillsMatter were kind enough to invite us to join in the event, however, there was some issue with food and SkillsMatter did initially exclude the Clojure group although eventually we were included in the event again.


**Code from today**

* [https://github.com/jr0cket/webapp-status-monitor/commit/ce60f78c35ce737333c9b9b24b83caca6b49b596](CIDER logo in Clojure SVG syntax)

<!-- more -->

## Service Monitor project

Work on the service monitor application and using SVG graphics

Created a rough version of the CIDER logo using Clojure SVG (hiccup) sytax.  Taking the HTML code for the logo, converted it to the Clojure SVG syntax.
