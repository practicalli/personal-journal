**Thoughts for the week**

Chasing references for my next potential employers

Quick write up about 4Clojure exercise #16 - Hello world.

**Code from today**

- [https://github.com/jr0cket/four-clojure/commit/639cf76e7901809413eb01f9c5a2f07187764ae0](4Clojure challenge #16 Hello World)

<!-- more -->


### 4Clojure challenge #16 Hello World

Discussing the `str` function to join values into a string.

Also covering how to write a simple function definition with `fn` and call that function inline.

For completeness, added the short form for a function definition using the reader macro `#()`


## Job hunting

Very successful interviews with a company using data science to drive efficiencies in farming.  The company processes a wide range of meteralogical and geological data to identify good locations for growing each kind of crop.  Following up with guidance on how to manage the crop through its lifecycle, e.g. expected weather patterns, etc.

I have asked for job references from Citi and Salesforce, although the replies are a little slow.
