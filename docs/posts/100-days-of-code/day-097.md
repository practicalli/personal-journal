## 4Clojure exercise #51 - advanced destructuring

Another chance to read up about destructuring.  

[Destructuring in Clojure - Clojure.org](https://clojure.org/guides/destructuring){target=_blank .md-button} 

Destructuring is a great way to reduce the amount of code you need to write by using pattern matching.  

We use destructuring to define local names from data structures, both in `let` functions and function definitions.

The challenge itself was fairly straight-forward, demonstrating a nested destructuring example.
