Interviewing for an Engineering Manager at an interesting FinTech company.

The [journey into Hyprland](#hyprland) continues its never ending (?) journey.  I recently discovered [:fontawesome-brands-github: HyDE](https://github.com/HyDE-Project/HyDE) which provides a rich desktop environment on top of Hyprland.  Initially the install script was used but it does seem that [:globe_with_meridians: HyDE-CLI](https://hydeproject.pages.dev/guides/cli/#installation) tool is a newer and seemingly more effective approach.

Continued to manage my digitised music, including Megadeth, Ozzy Osbourne, Bryan Adams and The Offspring.

## Hyperland

Some valuable fixes and updates were recently added to the [:fontawesome-brands-github: HyDE](https://github.com/HyDE-Project/HyDE) project which improves the rich desktop environment that HyDE configures on top of Hyprland.

Pulling updated commits and rerunning the `Scripts/install.sh` script did update all the Hyprland related configs but left the desktop in a broken state.

The HyDE Git Org also includes the [:globe_with_meridians: HyDE-CLI](https://hydeproject.pages.dev/guides/cli/#installation) tool which seems a newer and seemingly more effective approach. HyDE-CLI provides a terminal UI (TUI) allowing a simple way to select themes and other options.

As HyDE-CLI is a TUI it can be run on a pure terminal session, e.g. `Ctrl+Alt F3`, especially useful as I could not run a terminal after logging into Hyprland session.

I did have to removed `.config/hypr` directory and reran `Hyde-install` so that the install ran correctly and provided a working desktop environment.

### Touchpad

The vertical scrolling of the touchpad does not use natural scrolling, so the page scrolls as if moving the scroll bar rather than moving the page.

In the Input section of the Hyperland config generated by HyDE sets `natural_scroll = no`.  Change to `yes` to have natural scrolling.

I assume this setting would be overwritten with a HyDE update.

TODO: test if `natural_scroll` can be set in a user config that is not overwritten, e.g. `~/.config/hypr/userprefs.conf`

!!! EXAMPLE "Enable natrual scrolling for touchpad"
    ```config title="~/.config/hypr/hyprland.conf"
    # █ █▄░█ █▀█ █░█ ▀█▀
    # █ █░▀█ █▀▀ █▄█ ░█░

    # See https://wiki.hyprland.org/Configuring/Variables/

    input {
        kb_layout = us
        follow_mouse = 1

        touchpad {
            # natural_scroll = no
            natural_scroll = yes
        }

        sensitivity = 0
        force_no_accel = 1
        numlock_by_default = true
    }
    ```


### Kitty

HyDE provides a kitty configuration which overrode my kitty config.  My kitty config was in version control, so easy to restore.

HyDE includes a `userprefs.conf` file into which I copied my Kitty config fieles, except those configs related to themes.

!!! EXAMPLE
    ```conf
    # Set your personal kitty configuration here

    # ---------------------------------------------------------
    # Key bindings

    # Open new tab in current window
    map ctrl+shift+t launch --cwd=current --type=tab
    # ---------------------------------------------------------

    # ---------------------------------------------------------
    # Tab styles
    # fade slant separator powerline custom hidden
    tab_bar_style powerline
    tab_bar_align left
    tab_powerline_style angled

    # --------------------------------------------------------

    # ---------------------------------------------------------
    # Fonts

    # BEGIN_KITTY_FONTS
    font_family      family="FiraCode Nerd Font"
    bold_font        auto
    italic_font      auto
    bold_italic_font auto
    # END_KITTY_FONTS

    font_size 12

    # adjust_line_height  0
    # adjust_column_width 0
    # adjust_baseline 0
    # ---------------------------------------------------------
    ```

My Kitty config uses FirCode font which needed to be installed for Arch Linux

!!! NOTE "Instal Firacode font on Arch Linux"
    ```shell
    sudo pacman -S ttf-fira-code
    ```

### Zsh

The `~/.zshrc` file added by HyDE can be used to add personal configurations which should not be overwritten by HyDE updates.

HyDE contains its specific configuration in `~/.hyde.zshrc` and `~/.zshenv` which shouldnt be used for personal configuration as they would be overwritten by HyDE updates.

!!! EXAMPLE ".zshrc user configuration"
    ```bash
    # Add user configurations here
    # For HyDE not to touch your beloved configurations,
    # we added 2 files to the project structure:
    # 1. ~/.hyde.zshrc - for customizing the shell related hyde configurations
    # 2. ~/.zshenv - for updating the zsh environment variables handled by HyDE // this will be modified across updates

    #  Plugins 
    # oh-my-zsh plugins are loaded  in ~/.hyde.zshrc file, see the file for more information

    #  Aliases 
    # Add aliases here
    [[ ! -f ~/.config/shell-aliases ]] || source ~/.config/shell-aliases # (1)!

    #  This is your file 
    # Add your configurations here
    ```

    1.  Practicalli aliases included by loading `~/.config/shell-aliases`
