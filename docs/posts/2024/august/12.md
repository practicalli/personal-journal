**Thoughts for the week**

Enjoyed watching the Tetris movie and wondered just how much was real and dramatised.

I do remember the break-up of the USSR when it happened, first with Gorbachev as leader and then Boris Yeltsin.  Then the Oligarchs (super rich) moved in and supported a more draconian leader in Putin (assumingly so they could keep hold of all their money).

I also remember Robert Maxwell as a disgraced billionaire that stole from his own company and mysteriously vanished from his luxury yacht.

## How much Clojure needs to be known

A person is joining my team and it leads to wondering what they should feel comfortable in regards Clojure and how best I can support them.

I'm starting to identifying aspects of Clojure that would be beneficial to know well (not having to look them up), e.g. collections, sequences, map and reduce transformations, etc.  The [Clojure Cheatsheet](https://clojure.org/api/cheatsheet) provides a simple way to categorise the topics and functions of Clojure core namespace.

Which parts of the Clojure Standard Library would be useful, e.g. clojure.spec.alpha, clojure.data.json, etc.


## Neovim

Conjure may show an "unknown REPL environment" in the REPL log buffer when starting a new REPL session.  This is usually a timeout in detecting the REPL due to its startup being a little overloaded.

`, s l` lists the current REPL sessions in the REPL log buffer.
