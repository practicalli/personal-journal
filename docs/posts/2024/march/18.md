Enjoying being back in Debian Linux world, with [regolith desktop](https://regolith-desktop.com/) as the tiling window manager.

I have several Lenovo laptops and all but one are now upgraded to Debian Linux, using the testing version of the distribution.

The most significant difference with Debian Linux is the use of a separate root account for administration, rather than using `sudo` in Ubuntu Linux.

## Debian Linux with Regolith Desktop

Download the ISO image from Debian.org.  The default is the Net ISO which has the essential packages for Linux.

Create a bootable USB drive with the ISO image, on Linux this can be achieved by a simple copy command

!!! NOTE "Create bootable USB install for Debian Linux"
    ```shell
    cp debian-linux.iso /dev/sdb1
    ```

> `/dev/sda1` should be the main disk drive for the computer.  Use `df` command to check which mount points are the USB drive and computer hard drive.

Install Debian Linux from the Net ISO image by rebooting the computer.  Most modern laptops have a boot selection menu that shows when pressing ++"F12"++ ask the computer bios starts.

Follow the Debain Linux installer prompts.  At the end, select the Debian Desktop environmet.  Its also recommended to install the OpenSSH server and recommended tools (selected by default).

> If the Debian Desktop task is not installed, then not enough packages are added by Regolith Desktop to run an X Window session. Also the Sway Wayland package has unmet dependencies.

Reboot the computer after the install is complete.

Login to Debian Linux and download the Regolith Desktop install script.

=== "Download"

    !!! NOTE ""
        ```shell
        wget https://github.com/practicalli/dotfiles/regolith-desktop-install

??? EXAMPLE "Regolith Desktop - single install script for Debian Linux"
    ```shell
    apt install gpg && \
    wget -qO - https://regolith-desktop.org/regolith.key | \
    gpg --dearmor | tee /usr/share/keyrings/regolith-archive-keyring.gpg > /dev/null && \
    echo deb "[arch=amd64 signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/regolith-archive-keyring.gpg] \
    https://regolith-desktop.org/release-3_1-debian-bookworm-amd64 bookworm main" | \
    tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/regolith.list && \
    apt update && \
    apt install regolith-desktop regolith-session-flashback regolith-look-gruvbox
    ```

### Post install

Debian Linux installs a number of packages that I dont need, including Libre Office suite.

!!! NOTE "Remove Libra Office"
    ```shell
    apt purge libreoffice*
    ```
