Megalinter updates to version 8 using the megalinter runner tool, adding a Makefile task to simplify the command line (so I dont have to remember the command).

Material for MkDocs provides a nice diff view using the `diff` language for a code block. Add or copy a diff into the code block, ensuring the `-` and `+` signs are included and the diff is automatically highlighted.  See the [Megalinter](#megalinter) section of this post for an example.

Feeling quite low the last few weeks, mostly due to continued Covid symptoms, low blood oxygen and lack of energy.  Waking up I feel like I have experienced carbon dioxide poisoning (which I have experienced working on a mushroom farm).  I am disorientated, dizzy and feel quite terrible.

## Megalinter

Megalinter runner now includes a tool to update a megalinter configuration file to use the latest version of Megalinter.

```shell
npx mega-linter-runner@latest --upgrade
```

To simplify using the command a `megalinter-update` task was added to the `Makefile` for the project.

```make
megalinter-update:  ## Update MegaLinter config to latest version
	$(info --------- MegaLinter Upgrade Config ---------)
	npx mega-linter-runner@latest --upgrade
```

The script updates the Megalinter GitHub workflow to use the latest version of the Megalinter action.  The change respects if a specific flavour (e.g. java) of Megalinter was defined.

```diff
       - name: MegaLinter Run
         id: ml
         ## latest release of major version
-        uses: oxsecurity/megalinter/flavors/java@v7
+        uses: oxsecurity/megalinter/flavors/java@v8
         env:
           # ADD CUSTOM ENV VARIABLES OR DEFINE IN MEGALINTER_CONFIG file
           MEGALINTER_CONFIG: .github/config/megalinter.yaml
```

Links to the Megalinter documentation are also updated.

The script updates `.gitignore` to exclude the `megalinter-reports/` directory.  This change is not necessary for Practicalli projects as everything is ignored by default.  Patterns in the `.gitignore` are added with the `!` prefix, allowing them to be included by Git.


## Practicalli Project Templates

Each template configuration in Project Templates has their own megalinter workflow and configuration, so running the megalinter-runner upgrade tool is a good test.

From the output of the script, all templates were updated successfully.
