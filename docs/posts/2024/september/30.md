A friend recommended [Hyprland window manager](https://hyprland.org/) which is similar to i3 window manager I currently used, but more optomised for the Wayland compositor.

Practicalli currently uses Regolith Desktop, a complete Linux desktop that leverages Gnome and i3 tiling window manager. Regolith Desktop provides quite a rich experience using the `regolith-desktop` Debian package.  I have not had much success with Regolith when running with Wayland (specifically Sway).  Sway compositor is an implementation of wayland for i3 window manager.  Some of my applications do not see to play nice with Sway (e.g. chromium browser scrolling, simplescreenrecorder cannot run on wayland).

OBS did seem to work okay on wayland, given a sufficiently recent version.


A friend recommended Hyprland, a tiling compositor that provides the latest Wayland features and lots of eye candy.  Its pretty easy to setup on Debian, although there is much additional setup before it would be comparable to Regolith Desktop.




Neovim Grug plugin is being considered as an alternative to the Spectre tool for search and replacing across a project.

## Neovim Clojure navigation

Once I learned vim style commands and motions I quickly dropped much of the paredit style command, even before I tried parinfer.
Parinfer is really simple and easily covers a lot of the sexp-tooling when writing Clojure code.

Personally I find vim-style editing a bit simpler and easier to remember as I am using it for everything and not only one language.  There are typically as many key combinations to press with a sexp library as there are with vim.

There are a few manipulations I may still like the idea of, e.g. raise/promote a form or expression to refactor a nested expression to be the whole expression.

I have https://github.com/PaterJason/nvim-treesitter-sexp plugin installed, but havent used it much.  I use https://github.com/gpanders/nvim-parinfer plugin for parinfer enabled, in alignment mode, for all Clojure language buffers.


## Neovim Searching

For project wide search and replace, I currently use Spectre plugin via the Astrocommunity plugin.  It works okay and has a usable UI.

Grug looks interesting though, so time to try that at the weekend.


!!! NOTE "AstroNvim version"
    `:Astroversion` to receive the current version as a notification.

    ++spc++ ++"f"++ ++"n"++ to view the notification that contains the version number, eg. `Version: *4.26.5*`


## Hyprland on Debian

Throughout the history of Linux (and Unix), X.org has been used as the power driving all desktops.  More recently the Wayland compositor was developed to provide an alternative that catered for the way many desktops are used today.

There has been a lot of work put into Wayland and although it still has some maturing to do, is generally considered stable for every day use.

Hyprland is a wayland based tiling manager that has a focus on an engaging user experience (and looking very pretty too).

!!! WARNING "Review wayland app recommendations"
    Some well established apps and tools may not work quite so well with wayland yet.  e.g. simplescreenrecorder.

    [Hyperland utilities page](https://wiki.hyprland.org/Useful-Utilities/) recommends apps that work well with wayland (and hyprland)


### Install hyprland

I am using Debian Linux trixie (the next unrelease version of Debian).  The hyprland packages are from the v0.41.2 release in June 25 and the latest hyperland version is v0.44.0 (released as I was writing this paragraph)

Using the Debian packages will be simpler and quicker than compiling hyprland from source.  As I am only evaluating Hyprland and havent committed to it, I will stick with the Debian packages.

!!! NOTE "Install all hyprland Debian packages"
    ```shell
    apt install hyprland*
    ```

This install the packages:

Logout of the desktop or restart Debian Linux.

??? HINT "Use Debian Linux testing version"
    Hyprland recommends using Debian Sid version for the latest versions.  However, after [searching through the Debian Packages website for hyprland](https://packages.debian.org/search?keywords=hyprland&searchon=names&suite=all&section=all), the versions of matching packages are the same in trixie(testing) as sid(unstable).

    There may be differences in versions of packages that the hyprland packages have as dependencies,


??? HINT "Building Hyprland for Debian Linux"
    [drewfrif/debian-hyprland](https://github.com/drewgrif/debian-hyprland) has several bash scripts for semi-automating the build and install of hyprland on Debian Linux.

    There are some personal preferences in those scripts that could be changed, but it seems a good basis for automating your own build and install for all the hyprland components.

    [Hyprland v0.43.0](https://github.com/hyprwm/Hyprland/releases/tag/v0.43.0) requires C++ 26 support, which is provided by `gcc` package version >=14.  `gcc --version` reports 14.2.0 on Debian trixie, so all should be good

    ```shell
    ❯ gcc --version
    gcc (Debian 14.2.0-3) 14.2.0
    ```


### First use

On the login screen, select the login account, then select hyprland using the cog in the right hand corner

Enter the correct password to login with the hyprland desktop.

A yellow information bar is displayed at the top of the screen showing an autogenerated configuration file location, e.g. `~/.config/hypr/hyprland.conf`

The information bar also described keybindings to start a terminal, ++super++ ++"q"++, (kitty is my Debian default terminal) and  ++super++ ++"m"++ to quit hyprland destkop


!!! HINT "Practicalli dotfiles & hyprland"
    The autogenerated config file was moved to the [Practicalli dotfiles](https://github.com/practicalli/dotfiles) repository.

    A symbolic link replaced the `~/.config/hypr/` directory, linking to the hypr directory in the local copy of the Practicalli dotfiles repository.

    ```shell
    ln -s ~/projects/practicalli/dotfiles/hypr ~/.config/hypr
    ```



### Menu app launcher

Although Regolith has Rofi, it doesnt seem to be available when using hyprland desktop.

Options
- install the rofi debian package
- install one of the [suggested app launcher on the hyprland wiki](https://wiki.hyprland.org/Useful-Utilities/App-Launchers/)

I tried `rofi` first as its familiar from Regolith desktop.

```
apt install rofi
```

> There is a rofi-dev package, although assuming that is not needed if unless I build rofi extensions

Update the hyprland config to launch rofi for the menu and use ++super++ ++spc++ key binding (rather than ++super++ ++"R"++)

```
# bind = $mainMod, R, exec, $menu
bind = $mainMod, space, exec, $menu
```

The rofi guide suggests creating a configuration file

Create a rofi directory in .config

```shell
mkdir -p ~/.config/rofi
```
The dump all the config options into a file.  Most options are commented out.

```shell
rofi -dump-config > ~/.config/rofi/config.rasi
```

### Apps to install

- waybar - the desktop status bar (TODO: tweak its config or use someone elses config)



### Configure waybar

Create an appealing and rich desktop menu and status bar.

Handcrafting a config

```shell
❯ cp -vr /etc/xdg/waybar ~/projects/practicalli/dotfiles/
'/etc/xdg/waybar' -> '/home/practicalli/projects/practicalli/dotfiles/waybar'
'/etc/xdg/waybar/config.jsonc' -> '/home/practicalli/projects/practicalli/dotfiles/waybar/config.jsonc'
'/etc/xdg/waybar/style.css' -> '/home/practicalli/projects/practicalli/dotfiles/waybar/style.css'
❯ ln -s ~/projects/practicalli/dotfiles/waybar ~/.config/waybar
```


waybar uses font-awesome fonts for the icons

```shell
# apt search font-awesome
fonts-font-awesome/testing,now 5.0.10+really4.7.0~dfsg-4.1 all [installed,automatic]
  iconic font designed for use with Twitter Bootstrap


# apt install fonts-font-awesome
```

To use the workspaces module, replace all the occurrences of `sway/workspaces` with `hyprland/workspaces`. Additionally replace all occurrences of `sway/mode` with `hyprland/submap`


## nwg-shell

[nwg-look](https://github.com/nwg-piotr/nwg-look/) is a GTK3 settings editor, I assume similar to the Appearance in control center with some Gnome Tweaks thrown in.



Debian package install

```shell
# apt install nwg-
nwg-bar       nwg-clipman   nwg-displays  nwg-hello     nwg-look
root@gkar:/etc/apt/preferences.d# apt install nwg-*

### Wayland apps and tools support

Practicalli tools that work well with wayland

- OBS - recent versions support wayland
- Inkscape - TODO
- Neovim - works in a terminal so doesnt really care
- Neovide - TODO
- Emacs - TODO
- The Gimp - TODO
- Firefox - seems okay
- Chrome - a delay when opening tabs or scrolling windows (regoligh & sway)

## Install
Install the hyprland packages using `*` to glob match all the relevant packages.

!!! INFO "Install all hyprland Debian packages"
    ```shell
    apt install hyprland*
    ```

Once installed, either logout of the desktop session or restart Debian Linux.

Hyprland should be an option on the login screen. Once an account has been selected, click the cog icon to select hyprland (TODO: check if this is available after installing the package - or if some config is required)


### Configuration

Hyprland is described as easy to configure, but what actually is involved.  Is it as simple as adding hyprland packages or do I need to edit a configuration file?

Lets investigate...



### Gotchas

++super++ ++"c"++ will close the app in the active window.  As I use this key binding a lot in MacOSX for copy paste, then I should rebind this close action to something else, e.g. ++super++ ++shift++ ++"q"++ is the keybinding from regolith and less likely to be pressed in error.  Trying ++super++ ++shift++ ++"x"++ for now as there needs to be a key binding to quit Hyprland (logout and reboot do not work currently - shutdown does though)

## Material for MkDocs

Refining the experiments with [installing Material for MkDocs on Debian Linux](http://localhost:7777/journal/here-comes-the-rain/#material-for-mkdocs) this week.

Recap:

- Installing Material for MkDocs using Debian packages did work to a point, although there is no package for the RSS plugin (its relatively recent split from the main material-mkdocs package)
- Installing Material for MkDocs using python packages does cover all the plugins used by Practicalli books and websites.
- Debian issued warnings when using pip3 or pipx to install python packages outside of the Debian package system.
- Using a Python virtual environment is the recommended way to run Material for MkDocs (or any python libraries) on Debian Linux.

A python virtual environment was created and then Material for MkDocs python packages were installed using Pip.

`python3-venv` package creates a Python virtual environment given a directory

!!! NOTE "Create Python Virtual Environment"
    ```shell
    python3 -m venv ~/.local/venv/

## Slack for Debian

Download the debian package from the slack webstite (there is a small link in the right corner to a .deb file)

As the root user:

```shell
cd /home/practicalli/Downloads/
apt install ./slack-desktop-4.39.95-amd64.deb
```

Not that the deb file install complains about being installed by root account, but works anyway.
