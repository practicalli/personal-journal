**Thoughts for the week**

Its a bit too hot for rational thought... and caught flu at the end of the week, so not much happened.

Time for some project maintenance courtesy of the [scheduled version GitHub workflow](https://practical.li/engineering-playbook/continuous-integration/github/workflows/practicalli/#scheduled-version-check), run at the start of each month.
