**Thoughts for the week**

Exploring the mysteries of the Bazel build tool at work.  Whilst technically its a very powerful tool it really lacks a good developer experience.

Its supposed to be a more powerful make, although ironically I use a `Makefile` so that Bazel is much easier to use.

It could be an opportunity to use Babashka, but that would be more work than using a Makefile as I dont have much Babashka experience.

## Clojure CLI Config

Monthly library version updates, including newer versions of actions in the Quality Checks GitHub workflow

Also updated the version of the Practicalli Project Templates in the `:project/create` alias.  The templates have been updated to use `org.clojure/clojure` version `1.10.3`, which addresses security concerns (although very unlikely to be exploited).


## Bazel

Bazel is a very powerful tool although not very user friendly.  Bazel is described as a more powerful `make` tool, however, I have ended up using `make` to wrap many of the bazel commands to give a much more usable experience.
