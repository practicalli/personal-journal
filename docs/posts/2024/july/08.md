**Thoughts for the week**

Monthly updates for Practicalli projects, driven by a scheduled version GitHub workflow that uses antq to report on project library dependencies and GitHub action library versions.

- Release: Clojure CLI Config - 2024-07-07
- Release: Project Templates - 2024-07-07

Which-key version 3 released, fixing localleader issue and providing a horizontal menu option.

<!-- more -->

## Neovim

Which-key version 3 released and resolves the issue with the `localleader` key mapping not working until after the `leader` key has been pressed.

New layout options for placement of the menu.  I find the vertical nature of the `helix` layout quicker to read than the horizontal `classic` or `modern` layouts.

In AstroNvim, set the layout by adding a config for which-key to a user lua file, e.g. `lua/plugins/user-practicalli.lua`

```lua title="lua/plugins/user-practicalli.lua"
  {
    "folke/which-key.nvim",
    opts = {
      ---@type false | "classic" | "modern" | "helix"
      preset = "helix",
    },
  },
```

Restart Neovim and the which-key will now show the new layout.

### Conjure sub-menus

I've raised an issue to add the conjure sub-menus via which-key.

In the mean time, a quick hack has been added to the `lua/plugins/user-practicalli.lua` config (although only locally so far)

```lua
local whichkey = require "which-key"

  {
    "folke/which-key.nvim",
    opts = {
      ---@type false | "classic" | "modern" | "helix"
      preset = "helix",
    },

    -- Conjure sub-menus (not the ideal place)
    whichkey.add {
      { "<localleader>c", group = "Connection" }, -- group
      { "<localleader>e", group = "Evaluation" }, -- group
      { "<localleader>l", group = "REPL Log" }, -- group
      { "<localleader>r", group = "Refresh" }, -- group
      { "<localleader>s", group = "REPL Session" }, -- group
      { "<localleader>t", group = "Test" }, -- group
      { "<localleader>v", group = "Values" }, -- group
    },
  },
```
