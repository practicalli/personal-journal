500 day commit streak on GitHub reached today.  This was legitimately achieved by doing a small amount of work each day.

I am not actively coding and committing on a regular basis in my current role, so the large majority of these commits are for Practicalli or Open Source projects.

Continuing to simplify the Practicalli AstroNvim User Config, so changes from the AstroNvim template are in new files or in `community.lua`.

The most visual opinionated changes are in `practicalli.lua`, such as dashboard logo and theme.

Motivated to work on the [:fontawesome-solid-book-open: Practicalli Sustainable Life](https://practical.li/sustainable-life) book after joining a sustainability working group at the company.

## Neovim

[:fontawesome-brands-github: Practicalli User Config](https://github.com/practicalli/astronvim-user-config) theme changes have been moved from `lua/plugins/astroui.lua` to `practicalli.lua` to minimise changes from the original [:fontawesome-brands-github: AstroNvim template repository](https://github.com/AstroNvim/template/).

Minimising changes in the AstroNvim template simplifies merging updates from the [:fontawesome-brands-github: AstroNvim template repository](https://github.com/AstroNvim/template/), which are more likely due to AstroNvim 4 release being relatively recent.

Using separate files where possible also allows everyone to easily customise their experience when using [:fontawesome-brands-github: Practicalli User Config](https://github.com/practicalli/astronvim-user-config).  By adding or removing a comment from the `if` statement, the specific configuration file can be included or excluded when Neovim loads the configuration.

By essentially toggling one line in each file, a very minimal change is made and again makes merging changes between Practicalli configuration and anyone else configure much simpler.

!!! EXAMPLE "Comment if statement to include the configuration in the file"
    ```lua
    -- if true then return {} end -- WARN: REMOVE THIS LINE TO ACTIVATE THIS FILE
    ```

## Sustainability

Joined a sustainability group within the company and will be co-chairing the group.

Making milk from Hemp Seeds today, delicious.  Reminds me I should update the [::fontawesome-solid-book-open: Practicalli Sustainable Life](https://practical.li/sustainable-life/) book to MkDocs and add a lot more content.

My life is more sustainable that the average persons, although there is always more I can adapt to.

Joining the group via work I can share my personal experiences with others to inspire them.  I also aim to learn more about larger scoped initiatives and how the company can influence our potential partners and customers.

## Well-being

Exercise through gardening.  Digging up weeds in the garden so vegetables can be grown without interference.

Planning wellness activities for the company off-site.  Cycling along the coast on the first day and yoga on the second day.

Saturday ride with the local cycling club.  Lead a group of people along a 74km route with 1,018 meter hill climbing.  First time up the large hill along Exedown road, which peaked at 17% on a sharp bend.  No wonder I was quite tired by the end.

Ordered a very large bag of sand so I could level the patio flag stones at the end of the garden.  I'll be doing some planning to figure out how to level all the flag stones without having to keep moving the shed around.
