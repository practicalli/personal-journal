**Thoughts for the week**

As this week is mosly tweaks for Zsh history, I've titled this journal entry to be a play on words from the Shakesphere play 'Alls well that ends well'.

The `fd` built-in command for Zsh is a very effective way to keep the command history clean.

## Zsh

Every command typed at the prompt will be added to the Zsh history.  This provides a very efficient way to repeat commands.

When an incorrect command is used the usefulness of the history can be deminished, as those incorrect commands are also part of the history. 

Rather than navigating the history and changing the command, use the buildin `fd` command to edit the Zsh history.

The `fd` command is a simple tool to keep the Zsh history clean of incorrect commands.  A specific command can be edited and changed by specifying its number in the history order.  Or the whole history can be edited, especially useful if the command should be completely deleted.


!!! INFO "Avoid editing history directly"
    Use `fd` command to edit the history to ensure the cache is up to date.

    Editing $HISTFILE Zsh history file directly will not remove the command from the history cache and will show when navigating histor until logging out of the shell session.


## Engineering Playbook

Added [shell alias examples](https://practical.li/engineering-playbook/os/shell/) to Practicalli Engineering Playbook.

Rewrote the [Deliberate Practice](http://practical.li/engineering-playbook/practices/deliberate-practice/)overview and reorganised Architecture and Code Kata pages as sub-sections.
