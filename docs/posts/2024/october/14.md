I am enjoying my 2 week at home vacation (stay-cation) and have already completely rewired my desk, laptops, Monitors and NAS storage devices on the electronic standing desk.  It feels a lot more organised and easier to find everything as everything has its place.

Now I can focus on getting lots of [Practicalli content done](#practicalli) (as well as catch up with shows on Paramount+ and maybe a little Polybus on the Playstation4 VR headset)

I am taking a stay-cation as I am still recovering from Covid and the weather is also quite grim.  I am getting out for walks and will cycle if any days are dry enough...

## Practicalli

Plans for content development for the next two weeks

Neovim
- using neotree to navigate, e.g. ++backspace++ to navigate up the tree, ++enter++ to navigate into a directory, ++period++ to set the current directory as root (so actions become relevant to the project, e.g. file and word searches)



## Neovim - Neogit

Ensure the common git workflows are captured in [Practicalli Neovim](https://practical.li/neovim)

- create local tracking branch for a remote branch
- stage lines, hunks and files
- commit & commit amend
- signed commits and showing the signature is good (locally and on GitHub)
  - use rebase interactive to squash commits, e.g. some commits shouldnt be separate, managing commits that were not signed correctly.
- apply a patch file


AstroNvim updates - neogit

        6837a5d Feature: Two new user commands, `:NeogitLog` and `:NeogitCommit` can now be used to show all log entries for a specified file, or range within a file, and NeogitCommit can be used to show a detailed commit view for a specified SHA/commitish value (2 days ago)
