Busy week at work getting ready for a new team member.  I spent Friday afternoon building up a relationship and getting accustom to spending time working together.  Several weeks of work had been done to get ready for the new starter.

One of the interesting challenges for anyone starting a new job is to ensure too much enthusiasm doesnt lead to missing important steps.  It will be a good first check-in with the new starter to see if they have been too enthusiastic or taken a more measured approach.

Current issues

- **DONE** [security: add clj-watson to clojure cli config](https://github.com/practicalli/clojure-cli-config/issues/87)

<!-- more -->

## Clojure CLI Config

`:security/nvd-scan` and `:security/nvd-fix` aliases have been added to [Practicalli Clojure CLI Config](https://github.com/practicalli/clojure-cli-config).  Documentation on using these aliases still needs to be added.

The first time one of these aliases is run, the NIST National Vulnerability Database is downloaded locally.  This download can take a long time.

## Health

Back to work as Engineering Manager at Griffin for the platform team.  Its a great team to work for and they delivered a really important security feature whilst I was away.

My health is continuing to improve and I am aiming to complete a week of walking every day.  My stats from the last blood test were not good, but not the worst they have been.  Covid really impacts my health and I had very low blood oxygen last week which prevented ramping up my exercise routine.

I continue to have a cough and tight lungs, but it does feel like the symptoms are easing and my motivation to exercise returning.
