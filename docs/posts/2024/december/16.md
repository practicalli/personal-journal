In season 2, episode 2 of "The Big Door Prize" they talk about "Finding your Joy".  This seems like an inspiring new years resolution, or at least a theme I should focus on for 2025.

You only live one life and you should take time out to enjoy it.  There were many aspects to 2024 that constrained my joy, so I will endeavour to may 2025 a most joyous year.

## GitHub statistics

Earlier in 2024 I deleted many outdated repositories on GitHub that were not worth keeping.  However, this did take off over 600 contributions from my total.

At the end of last week my GitHub contributions broke the 15,000 total again.

I use the statistics only as a simple motivator to do something every day.  Most days it is a small task or updating the current journal entry to capture new things learned that day.

Github tracker offers statistics about a repository.  I believe this is a community website and not an official GitHub website (as the logo uses a lower case h)

At the end of the year I'll generate some yearly statistics from GitHub.


## Talk Idea - Communication Improbable

A talk idea from many years ago, which seems very relevant today too.

Talk Title: Communication Improbable

Description:

Given all the information we filter out and pass through our cognitive biases, its amazing we take notice of anyone.  
Covering why communication is such a monumental challenge, we give tangible practices & tips to increase the effectiveness of communication to your audience (whoever that may be)

Abstract:

Communicating with anyone is a major challenge when even the simplest idea can be misunderstood.  By telling the stories across common situations we will help you develop your skills at effectively communicating.

In our DevRel roles we need to get our message across to audiences large and small on subjects narrow and wide.  Underpinning all this communications is a level of trust, so without developing a trusted relationship you are much less likely to be heard.

There is a delicate balance of enthusiasm and pragmatism when talking to the developer community (or any community that gets too much hype on a regular basis).  The way we talk is interpreted many different ways by our audiences internal cognitive biases, so a great deal of empathy and emotional quotient is required to get your message across.

Putting the challenges an practices together, you will be able to greatly improve the effectiveness of your communication across different audiences.


Notes:

I was lucky enough to present the basics of this talk with Jessica Rose at Twilio Signal conference  and Salesforce Dreamforce.  We both received lots of great feedback and I have taken this talk further based on those ideas.  I've also make the content more specifically around the challenges faced by those in the DevRel community.

This could be a keynote talk or just a usual 30 minute talk.
