Feeling a little sick so binging on movies and shows on Apple TV+.  On Monday afternoon Apple TV+ would not stream content (the play button disappeared) although I could browse the catalogue of shows.  After several hours the play button came back, although contacting Apple support was quite pointless.

A relaxing week trying out some new vegetarian and vegan meals. [Pieminister Mooless Moo pie](https://shop.pieminister.co.uk/products/mooless-moo/) is a plant based stake and ale pie, using jackfruit for the stake pieces.  The pastry was lovely and crispy and the pie was very filling.  The only downside to the pie for me was it was the taste and texture was too much like beef and I've never really liked that even when I did eat meat.

New potatoes, Edamame, Spinach and Garden Peas complement the pie, along with some very thick [Bisto Best Vegetable Gravy](https://www.bisto.co.uk/products/bisto-best-vegetable-gravy-granules-230g/) (I add way too many granules to make the gravy nice and thick).

## Emacs

After reinstalling the operating system on a computer a few months ago and only just realised I had not installed Emacs.  An interesting sign that I have become very comfortable with [:fontawesome-solid-book-open: Neovim](https://practical.li/neovim).

Debian testing includes the [latest 29.4 release of Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/savannah-checkouts/gnu/emacs/emacs.html#Releases).

I followed the [:fontawesome-solid-book-open: Practicalli Spacemacs install guide](https://practical.li/spacemacs/install-spacemacs/) and confirmed it was still up to date.

## Practicalli Astro

The 2024-12-17 release included configuration to use a locally installed Clojure LSP server, rather than allow mason to manage the install.

The [Mason Registry](https://mason-registry.dev/registry/list) was updated to use the latest Clojure LSP server version, via [PR7896](https://github.com/mason-org/mason-registry/pull/7896).   Usually the versions are automatically updated via the [renovate GitHub action](https://docs.renovatebot.com/modules/manager/github-actions/), although this time the PR did not pass the tests so was not automatically merged.

The maintainer updated and merged the PR manually.

Practicalli Astro was updated to comment the configuration that was added to `lua/plugins/user-practicalli.lua` to use a local install of Clojure LSP.


## Debian Tracker

[Tracker service](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Tracker) indexes many types of files to enable discovery of files by other Gnome services and applications.

- [desktop search](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/IntegratedDesktopSearch)
- Tag database for keyword tagging
- Extensible metadata database to add custom metadata to files, e.g. rhythmbox, gedit, etc.
- Store First Class Objects and the Gnome 3.0 Model

> NOTE: when actively using Gnome desktop and Gnome apps, disabling the tracker may reduce functionality


### Disable the tracker service

The tracker service can be a significant drain on computer resources as it indexes files, especially when there have been a log of changes or for a newly installed system.

The tracker has many dependencies, so its not easy to remove the `tracker-miner-fs-3` package when actively using the Gnome desktop.

The recommended approach is to edit the `.desktop` files and add `Hidden=true` at the end of each tracker related file and reboot the operating system.

```config title="/etc/xdg/autostart/tracker-miner-fs-3.desktop"
[Desktop Entry]
Name=Tracker File System Miner
Comment=Crawls and processes files on the file system
Exec=/usr/libexec/tracker-miner-fs-3
Terminal=false
Type=Application
Categories=Utility;
X-GNOME-Autostart-enabled=false
X-GNOME-HiddenUnderSystemd=false
# X-KDE-autostart-after=panel
X-KDE-StartupNotify=false
X-KDE-UniqueApplet=true
NoDisplay=true
OnlyShowIn=GNOME;KDE;XFCE;X-IVI;Unity;
X-systemd-skip=true
Hidden=true
```

If adding "Hiddent=true" is not sufficient, then disable the services for all users by setting them to `/dev/null` using the `systemctl` command.

```shell
sudo systemctl --global mask tracker-miner-fs-3.service
sudo systemctl --global mask tracker-xdg-portal-3.service
```


Remove the database of indexed files from each user account on the system

```shell
rm -rf $HOME/.cache/tracker*
```


## Movie reviews this week


### Luck - 2022

![Luck - movie from 2022](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/6e/Luck_%282022%29_poster.png){align=right loading=lazy }

[Luck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luck_(2022_film)) is a fun animated film.  Sam is a very unlucky human who meets a very cute and lucky black cat called Bob, voiced by Sean Pegg.  I wish I was as lucky as Bob the cat.

Sam feeds Bob some food and finds Bob's lucky penny.

Includes a nod to the Japanese obsession with the cat.

Bob was sent to Section A113 which is an [easter egg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A113) referencing the class room number used for character animation students as the California Institute of the Arts, where some of the Pixar team used to study.

Apple TV+

### Wolfs

Brad Pitt and George Clooney bouncing off each other perfectly.  I really enjoyed this film and could watch again.

Apple TV+


### Constellation

Naoomi Rapace leads a very intriguing space drama that centers around an experiment to find 'other states of matter' and the effectives of that experiment.  Essentially what happens when your life splits and you start living in a world that is not quite your own.
