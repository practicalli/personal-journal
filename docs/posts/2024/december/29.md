As we come to the end of 2025 I continue to contemplate what is next?

Do I want to continue in the software engineering industry with its many systemic faults?

Or should I branch out and do something completely different?

[80,000 hours](https://80000hours.org/) is a guide to careers that have a positive impact on the world.

My searching for a new home are currently focusing on the East coast of Scotland (which is dryer than London at the moment).  Aberdeen (the granite city) has good support for cycling and a few cycle clubs in the area.

Wired up my Playstation 4 and VR headset to start playing games again. During more severe covid symptoms I couldnt wear the VR headset as it put too much pressure on my head. From an hour of play today, the VR headset felt okay.

I had a few quick games of Stardust and one surprisingly successful game of [Polybius](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLy9I_IfUBzKJgBTlbzRB0k4i1ARDVPSgy&si=Fq2TPODPdD1YQ6cI).

## Neovim

[Neovim 0.11.3 released](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/releases/tag/v0.10.3).

The nvim.appimage file was downloaded from the GitHub releases page, along with the SHA256 checksum.

Check the integrity of the file download

```shell
sha256sum --check nvim.appimage.sha256sum
```

Set the `nvim.appimage` file to executable.

```shell
chmod a+x nvim.appimage
```

Move the nvim.appimage to the shared executable path to make available to all users, renaming to nvim.


```shell
sudo mv nvim.appimage /usr/local/bin/nvim
```

### LSP file name refactor

Astrocommunity has the `nvim-lsp-file-operations` plugin packaged, so taking it for a test drive to see if I can refactor filenames and update namespace names (and vice versa).
