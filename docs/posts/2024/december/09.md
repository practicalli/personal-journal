## Dead is mainstream

When people state that some technology or practice is dead via the internet, it typically means that thing is the mainstream.

If something was truely dead, no one would feel the need to talk about it as that topic would not relate to anyone.

This technique is essentially click-bate and trying to persuade you to 'buy-in' to something else (usually for the profit of aother person)

## Appimage

[AppImage](https://appimage.org/) is way to package software for Linux which provides a universal executable.    They are created, in a file ending `.AppImage`.  Neovim no longer includes a Debian package with each new release, however, an AppImage is part of each release.

An Appimage can be downloaded and made executable and run directly from the command line.  This is enabled by FUSE libraries


!!! NOTE "Install Fuse 2 on Debian"
    ```shell
    apt install libfuse2t64
    ```

> NOTE: earlier versions of the package are called `libfuse2`



## Future Tiling Window Manager

I have been experimenting with [hyprland]() recently and its very fast experience but requires a lot of configuration and building software for Debian systems.

[miracle-wm](https://miracle-wm.org/) is a tiling Wayland window manager built on top of [canonical/Mir](https://github.com/canonical/mir) (libraries for building Wayland based shells).


Wayland has the promise of being more than desktop eye candy, but there is still a lot of development required for everyone to easily adopt it.

Tiling managers like hyprland and miricle-wm should provide a very fast and efficient desktop experience but there is still some maturity to gain when compared to Gnome, KDE and Regolith desktops.
